# StreamLooper

StreamLooper is a very simple video/music player.  
It's main feature is a loop selection.  
The loop will repeat endlessly.

# Usage

To open a file drag and drop it onto StreamLooper.  
Calling `streamlooper <file>` also works.

The first slider allows defining the start and end points of the loop.  
The second is a simple progressbar showing you where in file you are.

Supported file formats:
	For music:
	- mp3
	- ogg
	- wav
	
	For videos:
	- mp4
	- webm
	- ogv
	- mov
	- avi
